* Introduction
  We start with N-Triples, as they are defined in the [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-n-triples-20140225/][W3C recommendation]] because
  this is the smallest subset of non-XML RDF serialization.

* Creating a test file
  First we need some test file. We use the [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-n-triples-20140225/#sec-introduction][first]]
#+INCLUDE: "example1.nt" src ntriple
  and [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-n-triples-20140225/#sec-literals][third]]
#+INCLUDE: "example3.nt" src ntriple
  example from the specification.
