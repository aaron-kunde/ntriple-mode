* Introduction
  We start with N-Triples, as they are defined in the [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-n-triples-20140225/][W3C recommendation]] because
  this is the smallest subset of non-XML RDF serialization.

* Creating a test file
  First we need some test file. We use the [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-n-triples-20140225/#sec-introduction][first]]
#+INCLUDE: "example1.nt" src ntriple
  and [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-n-triples-20140225/#sec-literals][third]]
#+INCLUDE: "example3.nt" src ntriple
  example from the specification.

* Defining the mode
  Regarding to http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DerivedMode we take the approach
  of deriving the mode from the Fundamental Mode:
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (define-derived-mode ntriple-mode fundamental-mode "N-Triple"
      "N-Triple mode is a major mode for editing RDF-files serialized as N-Triples."
      )
  #+END_SRC
  Now we can switch to our example file and try:
  : M-x ntriple-mode
  This loads the N-Triple mode for this file, like it can be seen in the status
  line.
